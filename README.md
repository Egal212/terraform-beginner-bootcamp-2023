# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023

Semantic Versioning ðŸ§™
This project is going to utilise semantic versioning for its tagging .
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The general format will be

Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, e.g '1.0.1'

**MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
**MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
**PATCH** version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

## Install the terraform ClI

The TERRAFORM ClI installation instruction have changed due to gpgp keyring changes.

### Refactoring into Bash Scripts

While fixing the Terraform CLI gpg depreciation issues,we noticed that the bash script steps were a considerable amount more code so  we created a new BASH SCRIPT (bash_script)[./bin/install_terraform_CLI]'install_terraform_CLI' TO INSTALL THE TERRAFORM CLI.

- This will keep the gitpod task file ([.gitpod.yml]) tidy.
- This allows us an easier to debug and execute manually Terraform CLI install.
- This will allow better portability for other projects that need to install Terraform CLI
